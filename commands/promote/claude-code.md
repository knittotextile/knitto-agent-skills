# /promote

Pipeline stage: **SHIP**. Previous stage `/gate`. Last stage — nothing
follows this.

Open the PRs that carry `$ARGUMENTS`'s branch forward, now that `/qa` and
`/gate` have both passed. This is git-PR mechanics only — no CI/deploy
checks, no waiting on a release to go live. Its plan file is already in
`done/` (moved by `/gate` once review approved).

## Steps

1. Resolve `$ARGUMENTS` to the plan file. Confirm every closing checklist
   item is checked (feature items from `/dev`, verification from `/qa`,
   review from `/gate`, plan already in `done/`) — if anything is still
   open, say which stage to run first instead of proceeding.
2. If this repo uses the paired feature-branch + long-lived releases/*
   model ([`branching`](../../skills/branching/SKILL.md)'s own Step 0
   detects this):
   - Open a PR from `<slug>-main` into the trunk (`main`), if one isn't
     open already.
   - Also run `branching`'s `sync <slug>` step here (not as a separate
     command): create/update `<slug>-dev`, cherry-pick the commits not yet
     picked, and open/update a PR from `-dev` into the staging branch
     (`releases/sandbox` or `releases/staging` — check which one this repo
     has per `branching` Step 0; if both exist, ask the user which is the
     real target instead of guessing).
   - That's it — don't check whether merging triggers a deploy, don't look
     for a `releases/main` push, don't gate on CI. This command's job ends
     at "PRs opened."
3. If this repo doesn't use that model, just make sure `<slug>-main`'s PR
   into the trunk branch is open per whatever convention this repo's docs
   describe — still no deploy/CI checks.
4. Offer to clean up branches once the PRs are merged (ask first, don't
   delete unilaterally — see `branching`'s own cleanup step).

## What this is not

- Not a way to bypass `/qa` or `/gate` to ship faster — refuse to promote a
  plan with open verification or review items, and say so plainly.
- Not a deploy/release step — it never checks CI, never touches
  `releases/main`, never waits for anything to go live. It only opens PRs.
- Not for shipping more than one plan file per invocation.
